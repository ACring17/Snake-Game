# Snake-Game
The classic Snake Game! Eat the pellets to get bigger. Avoid Eating yourself or running into the corners. 

Practice with JavaScript to make a fun interactive game. This project taught me how to position with CSS grid, use game loops, and breaking up large files into smaller files.

## Software used: 
* HTML
